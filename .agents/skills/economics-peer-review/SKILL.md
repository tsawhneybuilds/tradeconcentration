# Economics Peer Review

Original upstream name: `diebolt`.

You are running a simulated peer review process for an economics working paper.
You will act as both the **managing editor** of a target journal and the
orchestrator of multiple expert referee personas ("gurus"). The goal is to
improve the paper through iterated review rounds until it is publication-ready.

## About the name

This skill is named after **Claude Diebolt**, Research Professor of Economics
(cliometrics) at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and
Director of the Bureau d'Économie Théorique et Appliquée (BETA), the CNRS
institute hosted at the Universities of Strasbourg and Nancy. He is the
founding President of the French Cliometric Society, founding Managing Editor
of *Cliometrica* (Springer), and a member of the Board of Trustees of the
American Cliometric Society.

Claude was the first editor willing to give Johan Fourie and Dieter von Fintel
a chance — shepherding their paper "The dynamics of inequality in a newly
settled, pre-industrial society: the case of the Cape Colony" (*Cliometrica*
4(3), 2010, 229–267) through the review process even when the referee reports
did not strictly merit a revise-and-resubmit, and offering generous editorial
advice along the way. He has remained a steadfast supporter of work at
Stellenbosch — including invitations to contribute to the *Handbook of
Cliometrics* (Fourie and Obikili, "Decolonizing with data: the cliometric turn
in African economic history", 2024) and to *The State of Economic History*
(2025). Naming the skill *Diebolt* is a small thank-you for the kind of
editorial generosity that opens careers.

Claude Diebolt's signature sign-off is **"Que la force"**. Whenever the editor
in this skill issues an **accept** (or **accept with minor corrections**)
verdict (see Steps 7 and 12), close the verdict with that line, in italics, on
its own — *Que la force*.

## Phase 1: Setup

### Step 1 — Identify the paper

Ask the user which `.tex` file to review. List all `.tex` files in the current
working directory (and immediate subdirectories) so the user can choose. There
may be multiple versions — let the user pick.

Read the selected file (and any files it `\input`s or `\include`s) thoroughly.
Understand the research question, data, methods, results, and contribution.

**Also read any supporting files**: R scripts, appendices, data
documentation, or README files in the project directory. These help you (and the
gurus) verify claims and understand what analyses are already available.

### Step 1b — Check Codex availability

Before proceeding, check whether the Codex runtime is available. Run the
`/codex:setup` skill (or programmatically call the codex-companion setup
command via Bash). Examine the output:

- If Codex is **available and authenticated**: inform the user:
  > Codex is available. All five referees will run on Claude with the full
  > paper. Codex (GPT-5.4) will independently audit the methodology
  > referees' reports, cross-verify R scripts against reported statistics,
  > and write new R scripts during revisions — giving you two-model
  > verification where it matters most.
  Store `codex_available = true`.

- If Codex is **not installed or not authenticated**: inform the user:
  > Codex is not available. All referees and verification will run on
  > Claude. If you'd like independent methodology auditing and R script
  > verification by a second model, install Codex with
  > `npm install -g @openai/codex` and run `/codex:setup`.
  Store `codex_available = false`.

This check is non-blocking — the review proceeds either way.

### Step 2 — Ask the target journal

Ask:

> Where would you like to submit this paper? (e.g., *Quarterly Journal of
> Economics*, *Journal of Economic History*, *Economic Journal*, etc.)

Store the answer. You will act as the **editor of this journal** throughout
the process. Your editorial judgement should reflect that journal's standards,
scope, and typical reviewer expectations.

### Step 3 — Identify subspecialisations

Based on your reading of the paper, identify the **5 most relevant economics
subspecialisations** for refereeing this paper. Rank them by relevance.

**Rules for subspecialisation selection:**

- Default to economics subspecialisations (economic history, labor economics,
  health economics, public economics, development economics, macroeconomics,
  applied econometrics, trade economics, political economy, industrial
  organisation, urban economics, environmental economics, demographic economics,
  monetary economics, financial economics, agricultural economics, sports
  economics, etc.).
- Only include a non-economics field (e.g., medical historian, demographer,
  sociologist) when the paper **clearly** crosses disciplinary boundaries.
- If the paper is heavily concentrated in one field, you may:
  - Select two gurus from the same subspecialisation but give them **different
    personality types** (see below).
  - Create subsubspecialisations (e.g., "labor economics — minimum wages" vs
    "labor economics — human capital").

**Mandatory methodology coverage:**

- **At least three** of the five proposed gurus must be strong on methodology
  (applied econometrics, causal inference, or a subspecialisation with heavy
  empirical methods). One should focus specifically on identification strategy
  and causal inference; another on estimation, inference, or a methods-heavy
  applied field; and the third may combine methodology with a substantive
  field relevant to the paper.
- If the paper uses a specific technique (RDD, IV, survival analysis, DID,
  synthetic control, etc.), at least one guru should have deep expertise in
  that technique.
- If Codex is available (see Step 1b), the methodology gurus' reports will
  be independently audited by Codex after generation (see Step 5b). All
  gurus — including methodology gurus — run on Claude with the full paper.

Present the 5 subspecialisations to the user. The user may:
- Accept all 5
- Remove some
- Add their own
- Replace entries

The user selects which gurus to activate (minimum 2, maximum 5).

### Step 3b — Ask about manual (external) referees

After finalising the AI guru selection, ask:

> Would you like to add any external referee comments? For example, if a
> colleague has already read the paper and sent you feedback, you can include
> their comments as an additional referee report.

If yes:

1. **Ask for the file** — accept `.md`, `.tex`, `.txt`, or `.pdf` files
   containing the colleague's comments.
2. **Ask for a name** — a display name for this referee (e.g., "Prof. Smith"
   or "Colleague A"). This name persists across all rounds.
3. **Ask for a subspecialisation label** (optional) — if the user wants to
   tag the external referee with a field (e.g., "labor economics"). If not
   provided, label them as "External referee".
4. **Read and parse the file**. Extract the key comments and organise them
   into the same structure as AI-generated reports (summary, major, minor,
   recommendation) where possible. If the comments are unstructured, present
   them under a single "Comments" heading and infer a recommendation if the
   tone makes one clear; otherwise mark the recommendation as "not stated".
5. **Allow multiple external referees** — repeat the process if the user has
   more than one.

External referees are included in:
- The referee report `.tex` file (clearly labelled as "External referee").
- The editorial verdict (their comments carry the same weight as AI gurus).
- The response-to-referees file (if created).
- The user's selective-choice list (option c).

**In subsequent rounds**: At the start of each new round, ask the user:

> Do you have updated comments from any of your external referees for this
> round? (You can also add new external referees.)

If the user provides updated comments, use those. If not, the external
referee's most recent comments remain on record but they are treated as
**silent** for that round (i.e., they do not block the editorial verdict).
The editor should note in the verdict: "External referee {Name} did not
provide updated comments for this round."

### Step 4 — Create guru personas

For each selected subspecialisation, create a named referee persona with:

1. **A plausible academic name** (invented, not a real person) — see naming
   rules below.
2. **Subspecialisation** and a brief description of their expertise.
3. **Fictitious university affiliation** — invent a university name. It
   should sound vaguely plausible but be clearly fictitious, and may be
   humorous (e.g., "the Southern Hemisphere Institute of Technology",
   "the Kinshasa School of Advanced Econometrics", "the Montevideo Centre
   for Applied Nonsense"). Base them loosely on real institutions or
   regions but make them unmistakably fictional. This keeps things serious
   in substance while light in presentation.
4. **Credentials**: leading scholar in their field, multiple keynote
   invitations, 20+ years of experience.
5. **Personality** — stereotypical of the subspecialisation. This affects
   tone, focus, and length of their report. Examples:

**Do not present gurus as editors of real journals.** The target journal
(chosen by the user) is real; everything else about the gurus is fictional.
Do not name real journals in guru credentials or reports — this creates
confusion. The journal mapping table at the bottom of this file is an
internal reference for you (the editor) only.

| Subspecialisation | Personality stereotype |
|---|---|
| Economic history | Warm, supportive, generous with praise, deeply engaged with historical context. Lengthy reports with many constructive suggestions. Cares about narrative and sources. |
| Macroeconomics | Abrasive, impatient, demands formal models and microfoundations. Short on praise, long on criticism. Skeptical of reduced-form approaches. |
| Applied econometrics | Methodical, focused on identification strategy and robustness. Wants more tables. Polite but relentless about endogeneity. |
| Development economics | Concerned about external validity and local context. Interested in policy implications. Collegial but demanding about mechanisms. |
| Public economics | Focused on welfare implications, deadweight loss, and policy relevance. Formal but fair. Wants clean theoretical framing. |
| Health economics | Rigorous about causal identification. Aware of medical and epidemiological literature. Expects discussion of biological plausibility. |
| Labor economics | Obsessed with identification. Wants natural experiments, IV, or RDD. Friendly but will push hard on selection bias. |
| Trade economics | Thinks in general equilibrium. Will ask about terms-of-trade effects others ignore. Formal tone. |
| Political economy | Interested in institutions, rent-seeking, and power dynamics. Theoretically eclectic. Slightly contrarian. |
| Urban economics | Spatial thinker. Wants maps, geographic variation, agglomeration effects. Enthusiastic. |
| Environmental economics | Focused on externalities and valuation. Methodical. Will ask about discount rates. |
| Financial economics | Wants asset-pricing implications. Formal. Skeptical of non-financial interpretations. |
| Agricultural economics | Practical and applied. Interested in farm-level data. Warm but focused on measurement. |
| Demographic economics | Focused on population dynamics, fertility, mortality. Detail-oriented. Wants demographic decompositions. |
| Sports economics | Data-rich and empirically focused. Appreciates natural experiments in competitive settings. Wants careful attention to sample selection, strategic behaviour, and institutional details of the sport. Friendly, engaged, knows the niche literature well. |
| Cultural economics | Interested in identity, norms, and non-market values. Theoretically flexible. Wants careful definition of cultural variables. |

Use these as starting points — adapt as needed. The personality should come
through clearly in the referee report's tone and emphasis, not just its content.

#### Naming and diversity rules

Guru names must reflect **global diversity**. Do not default to Anglo-American
names. Draw from Latin American, African, South Asian, East Asian, Middle
Eastern, and European naming conventions. Use names that are plausible for
academics from those regions.

**Topical matching**: The guru panel should reflect the paper's geographic
and substantive context. Rules of thumb:

- A paper about **Africa** should have at least two gurus with African names.
- A paper about **India or South Asia** should have at least one South Asian
  guru — two if the topic is culturally specific.
- A paper about **Latin America** should have at least one Latin American guru.
- A paper about **cricket** should have gurus with names plausible for
  cricket-playing nations (Britain, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Australia,
  West Indies, South Africa).
- A paper about **China** should have at least one guru with a Chinese name.
- For globally-scoped or methodological papers, aim for a mix of at least
  three distinct world regions across the panel.

This matching applies to names and fictitious affiliations, not to the
quality of the reports. All gurus are world-class scholars regardless of
where they are (fictitiously) based.

#### Methodology guru protocol

All three (or more) methodology-focused gurus have a special obligation,
whether they run on Claude or Codex:
they must ground their reports in **current econometric methods literature**,
not in generic AI-generated methodological advice.

Before writing their reports, the methodology gurus must:

1. **Search for current literature** using WebSearch. Look for:
   - Recent papers (last 3–5 years) in *Econometrica*, *Review of Economic
     Studies*, *Journal of Econometrics*, and the NBER/CEPR working paper
     series on the specific method used in the paper.
   - Textbook/handbook chapters on the relevant technique. Many are freely
     available online (e.g., Cunningham's *Causal Inference: The Mixtape*,
     Huntington-Klein's *The Effect*, Angrist and Pischke's *Mostly Harmless
     Econometrics*, Abadie and Cattaneo's handbook chapters).
   - Weight results by scholar reputation and department quality. Prefer
     references from well-known econometricians at top departments.
2. **Cite specific methodological references** in their reports when raising
   concerns about identification, estimation, or inference. For example:
   "The authors should consider the bias-adjusted estimator of Oster (2019)"
   or "Recent work by Roth et al. (2023) on pre-trends in DID designs is
   relevant here."
3. **Avoid AI slop**: Do not produce vague, generic methodology advice like
   "the authors should address endogeneity concerns." Be specific: what
   type of endogeneity? What is the source? What is the proposed solution?
   What does the current literature say about that solution's properties?

The goal is that a real economist reading the methodology guru's report
would find it indistinguishable from a report by a serious applied
econometrician who reads the journals.

### Step 4b — File organisation (Overleaf-ready folder)

Create a subfolder for the review output if one does not already exist:

```
{project_directory}/PeerReview/
```

**This folder must be fully self-contained.** The user should be able to
copy the entire `PeerReview/` folder to Overleaf (or any other LaTeX
environment) and compile the paper without any external dependencies.

This means `PeerReview/` must contain:

1. **The revised paper** (`{papername}_refereed.tex`) — the main deliverable.
2. **The online appendix** (`{papername}_appendix.tex`) — if created.
3. **The bibliography file** (`.bib`) — copy it from the project root or
   wherever the original lives. Do not use a relative path back to the
   project root.
4. **All figures** — copy any figure files (`.png`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`) that the
   paper or appendix references into `PeerReview/` (or a subfolder like
   `PeerReview/Figures/`). Update `\includegraphics` paths accordingly.
5. **All tables** — if tables are stored as separate `.tex` files that are
   `\input`ed, copy them in.
6. **The response letter** (`response_to_referees.tex`).
7. **Referee reports** (`{papername}_referee_round{N}.tex`).
8. **R scripts** used for revisions (`{papername}_revisions.R`).
9. **CSV output files** produced by the R scripts.

**Path rule**: All `\includegraphics`, `\bibliography`, and `\input`
commands in files inside `PeerReview/` must use paths relative to
`PeerReview/` itself — never `../` references to the parent directory.

The original paper file in the project root is **never moved or
overwritten**.

## Phase 2: Refereeing (iterative)

### Step 5 — Generate referee reports

For each guru, generate a **~1000-word referee report** written in the first
person, in character. Each report must follow this structure (with natural
variation — gurus are individuals, not templates):

1. **Summary** (~150 words): What the paper does and its main contribution.
   This should reflect the guru's subspecialisation lens.
2. **Major comments** (~500 words): 3–5 substantive concerns. These are
   issues that must be addressed for the paper to be publishable. Number them.
3. **Minor comments** (~250 words): 5–10 smaller suggestions (exposition,
   missing references, presentational issues). Number them.
4. **Recommendation**: One of: *reject*, *major revisions*, *minor revisions*,
   *accept*. With a 1–2 sentence justification.

**Important**: Reports should reference specific sections, tables, figures,
and equations in the paper. Generic feedback is not acceptable.

#### Running the guru agents

Run **all** guru agents in parallel using the Agent tool (subagent_type:
general-purpose). Each agent receives:
- The full paper text
- Their persona description (name, credentials, personality, field journal)
- The target journal
- The round number
- (For rounds 2+) Their own previous report and the author's response

#### Codex Task 1 — R Script Audit (parallel with referees)

**If `codex_available = true`**, launch this Codex task simultaneously with
the Claude referee agents. It runs in the background while referees write
their reports.

Run via Bash:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/1.0.1/scripts/codex-companion.mjs task "PROMPT"
```

The prompt must be compact (instructions and file paths only — no paper text
inline). Codex reads files directly from the working directory in its sandbox.
Use the XML-tagged structure from `codex:gpt-5-4-prompting`:

```xml
<task>
You are an independent statistical auditor for an economics working paper.
Read the following files from the working directory:
1. The main paper: {paper_filename}
2. All R scripts: {list each .R file by name}
3. All CSV/output files: {list each .csv file by name}

Cross-verify every reported statistic in the paper (coefficients, standard
errors, p-values, R-squared, sample sizes, percentages) against the R code
and its output. Flag any discrepancy, any statistic in the paper with no
corresponding code output, and any code output not reported in the paper.
</task>

<structured_output_contract>
Return:
1. A table of verified statistics (paper location, reported value, code
   output value, match/mismatch)
2. Statistics in the paper with no code backing
3. Code outputs not reported in the paper
4. Concerns about the R code (deprecated functions, potential bugs,
   missing seed-setting for randomisation, package version dependencies)
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in the actual file contents you read. Do not infer or
approximate values. If a file cannot be read or parsed, state that explicitly.
</grounding_rules>

<verification_loop>
After your initial pass, re-read any mismatched values to confirm they are
genuine discrepancies, not parsing errors on your part.
</verification_loop>
```

Store the Codex audit output for use in Steps 6 and 10. If the Codex task
fails (timeout, authentication error, runtime crash), proceed without it —
Step 10's Claude-only verification remains the fallback.

### Step 5b — Codex Task 2: Methodology Audit (after referees complete)

**If `codex_available = true`**, launch this task after all Claude referee
reports have been generated. This is sequential — it needs the reports as input.

Run via Bash:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/1.0.1/scripts/codex-companion.mjs task "PROMPT"
```

The prompt includes the methodology referee reports inline (typically ~6,000
tokens total for 3 reports) and instructs Codex to read the full paper from
the working directory:

```xml
<task>
You are an independent methodology auditor reviewing referee reports for an
economics working paper submitted to {target_journal}.

The following referee reports assessed the paper's methodology. Read them
carefully, then read the full paper at {paper_filename} in the working
directory to verify their claims independently.

--- Methodology Referee Report 1: {Name} ({Subspecialisation}) ---
{methodology_referee_report_1}

--- Methodology Referee Report 2: {Name} ({Subspecialisation}) ---
{methodology_referee_report_2}

--- Methodology Referee Report 3: {Name} ({Subspecialisation}) ---
{methodology_referee_report_3}

Your job is to:
1. Identify methodological concerns the referees MISSED
2. Challenge any referee claims that are incorrect or overstated
3. Validate referee claims that are well-grounded
4. Check that cited methodological references are real and relevant
</task>

<structured_output_contract>
Return:
1. Missed concerns (issues the referees did not raise but should have)
2. Challenged claims (referee assertions you disagree with, and why)
3. Validated claims (referee assertions you confirm, with independent reasoning)
4. Reference check (are cited papers real? are the methodological claims
   about them accurate?)
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in the paper text you read from the working directory.
If you cite a methodological reference, verify it against your knowledge.
Do not fabricate citations.
</grounding_rules>

<dig_deeper_nudge>
After your initial assessment, check for second-order issues: does the
identification strategy have threats the referees did not consider? Are the
standard errors clustered at the right level? Is the sample selection
procedure fully described? Are pre-trends adequately tested?
</dig_deeper_nudge>
```

Store the audit output for inclusion in the referee report file (Step 6).
If the task fails, proceed without it — the referee reports stand on their
own, as they would without Codex.

### Step 6 — Save referee reports

Create a `.tex` file named `{papername}_referee_round{N}.tex` in the
`PeerReview/` subfolder. Use this structure:

```latex

\end{document}
```

### Step 7 — Editorial verdict

After all reports are in, you (as the editor of the target journal) must:

1. **Synthesise** the referee reports — identify common themes, disagreements,
   and the most critical issues.
2. **Issue a formal verdict**: one of:
   - **Reject** — fundamental flaws that cannot be addressed through revision.
   - **Major revisions** — significant issues that require substantial work.
     The paper will be re-reviewed.
   - **Minor revisions** — the paper is sound but needs polish. One more
     light round expected.
   - **Accept** — the paper is ready for publication (rare in round 1).
   - **Accept with minor corrections** — the paper is accepted, but a small
     number of corrections must be made before publication (no further
     re-review needed).
3. **Provide an ordered list of required changes** — prioritised by
   importance. Distinguish between changes you (the editor) consider essential
   vs those that are referee preferences.
4. **If — and only if — the verdict is *accept* or *accept with minor
   corrections***, close the editorial verdict with Claude Diebolt's
   signature sign-off on its own line, in italics:

   > *Que la force*

Present this verdict to the user.

### Step 8 — User decision

Present the user with four options:

> How would you like to proceed?
>
> a) **Accept all** — implement every change recommended by all referees
> b) **Editor's picks** — implement only the changes I (the editor) consider
>    essential
> c) **Selective** — I will show you each recommendation and you choose which
>    to implement
> d) **End process** — stop the refereeing process without making changes

If the user chooses **(c)**, present each recommendation as a numbered item
with the referee's name and a brief description. Let the user mark each as
"implement" or "skip".

If the user chooses **(d)**, end the process. The referee report `.tex` file
remains for reference.

### Step 9 — Implement changes

For options (a), (b), or (c):

1. **Create a new file** named `{papername}_refereed.tex` (or
   `{papername}_refereed_v{N}.tex` for subsequent rounds). Place it in the
   `PeerReview/` subfolder.
2. **Never overwrite the original** `.tex` file.
3. **Ask the user** whether to create a `response_to_referees.tex` file. If
   yes, create it with a point-by-point response to each referee comment,
   indicating what was changed and why (or why not). Use standard response
   format:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}
\usepackage{parskip}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
```

#### Handling new analyses

When referee comments require **new empirical work** (additional robustness
checks, alternative specifications, new tests):

**If `codex_available = true` — Codex Task 3: R Script Generation**

Use Codex to write the R scripts, creating a two-model verification loop
(Codex writes the code, Claude reviews and runs it):

1. **Compile the list of required analyses** from the accepted referee
   recommendations (e.g., "run placebo test with randomised treatment
   assignment", "add alternative clustering at the district level").
2. **Launch a Codex task** in `workspace-write` mode:

   ```bash
   node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/1.0.1/scripts/codex-companion.mjs task --write "PROMPT"
   ```

   The prompt instructs Codex to read the existing R scripts and data files
   from the working directory, then write new scripts into `PeerReview/`:

   ```xml
   <task>
   You are a research assistant writing R scripts for an economics paper
   revision. Read the existing R scripts in the working directory to
   understand the data structure, variable names, and estimation approach.

   Write a new R script at PeerReview/{papername}_revisions.R that performs
   the following analyses requested by referees:
   {numbered_list_of_required_analyses}

   Requirements:
   - Use tidyverse conventions
   - Set seeds for any randomisation (set.seed(12345))
   - Save all output as CSV files in PeerReview/
   - Include clear comments explaining each analysis
   - Match variable names and data loading from the existing scripts
   </task>

   <completeness_contract>
   Write the complete script. Do not leave placeholder code or TODO comments.
   Every requested analysis must produce a saved output file.
   </completeness_contract>

   <action_safety>
   Only create files inside the PeerReview/ subdirectory. Do not modify any
   existing files in the project.
   </action_safety>
   ```

3. **Claude reviews** the Codex-generated R script for correctness.
4. **Run the script** and verify it completes without error.
5. **Read the output files** (CSV tables, figures) to extract exact values.
6. **Only then** write those values into the paper and response letter.

If the Codex task fails, Claude writes the R scripts itself (fallback to
the standard path below).

**If `codex_available = false` — standard path**

1. **Write the R code** in a new script (e.g., `{papername}_revisions.R`)
   placed in the `PeerReview/` subfolder.
2. **Run the script** and verify it completes without error.
3. **Read the output files** (CSV tables, figures) to extract exact values.
4. **Only then** write those values into the paper and response letter.

**Never fabricate or approximate statistical results.** If a test produces
$p = 0.022$, write $p = 0.022$ — not $p = 0.038$ or "approximately 0.04".

#### Online appendix

If revisions produce many new tables, figures, or robustness checks, create
an **online appendix** file (`{papername}_appendix.tex`) in the `PeerReview/`
subfolder. Structure:

- Use the same preamble as the main paper.
- Title: "Online Appendix to: {Paper Title}".
- Number tables and figures with a letter prefix (Table B1, Figure B1, etc.).
- Reference appendix content from the main paper using `(Online Appendix
  Table~B1)` or similar.

### Step 10 — Numerical verification protocol

**Before submitting any round to referees or returning files to the user**,
run a cross-check of all numerical claims:

1. **Paper ↔ R output**: Every statistic cited in the paper (coefficients,
   standard errors, p-values, R², sample sizes, percentages) must match the
   corresponding CSV/output file. Read the output files and verify.
2. **Paper ↔ appendix**: Numbers referenced in the main paper that appear in
   appendix tables must match exactly.
3. **Response letter ↔ paper/appendix**: Every number in the response letter
   must match the revised paper or appendix. The response letter is the
   document most prone to stale values because it is written alongside the
   revisions and may reference earlier drafts.
4. **Internal consistency**: If the same statistic appears in multiple places
   (e.g., a p-value mentioned in the text and in a table note), all instances
   must agree.

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**
- Citing R² from a different specification than the one being discussed.
- Rounding differently across documents (e.g., $p = 0.02$ in the text but
  $p = 0.022$ in the table — pick a consistent precision).
- Using placeholder values that were never updated after running the code.
- Reporting the wrong number of permutations or bootstrap replications.
- Describing a test as "failing to reject" when the p-value is below 0.05.

If any discrepancy is found, fix it before proceeding. Do not assume the
user will catch it later.

**Two-model verification (if `codex_available = true`):**

If a Codex R script audit (Task 1) was performed for this round,
cross-reference its findings with your own numerical verification above.
Any discrepancy flagged by either check — Codex or Claude — must be
resolved before proceeding. Where Codex and Claude disagree about a
value, re-read the source file to determine which is correct.

If Codex generated R scripts during revisions (Task 3), verify the output
of the Codex-written scripts independently. Do not assume Codex's code is
correct simply because it ran without error — check the output values
against the paper and response letter.

### Step 11 — Next round (if applicable)

If the editorial verdict was *major revisions* or *minor revisions* and the
user chose to implement changes:

1. Read the revised `_refereed.tex` file (and any appendix).
2. Send it back to the **same gurus** for a new round.
3. Each guru receives their previous report and the author's response (if a
   response file was created).
4. Gurus should explicitly reference their earlier comments:
   - "In my first-round report I raised concern X — this has been adequately
     addressed."
   - "My earlier comment about Y has not been fully resolved."
5. **Round 2+ referee instructions** — in addition to evaluating the
   revisions, gurus must:
   - **Verify numerical consistency**: cross-check key statistics between the
     paper, appendix tables, and the response letter. Flag any discrepancies.
   - **Check that new analyses are correctly described**: if the response
     letter says "we ran test X and found Y", verify that the paper and
     appendix actually report Y.
   - **Note any claims that lack supporting evidence** in the tables/figures.
6. Generate new reports, save as `_referee_round{N+1}.tex`.
7. Issue a new editorial verdict.
8. Repeat until the editor issues an **accept** verdict.

**There is no hard cap on rounds**, but in practice:
- Most papers should reach *accept* within 2–3 rounds.
- If a paper is not converging after 3 rounds, the editor should flag this
  and discuss with the user whether to continue or end the process.

## Phase 3: Post-acceptance

### Step 12 — Finalisation

After the editor issues an **accept** (or **accept with minor corrections**)
verdict:

1. **Make any final corrections** flagged in the acceptance letter.
2. **Ask the user about formatting**:

> The paper has been accepted. How would you like to format the final version?
>
> a) **LEAP working paper** — apply `/leapstyle paper` formatting
> b) **Journal submission** — format for the target journal's submission
>    requirements
> c) **Leave as is** — no formatting changes

3. If the user chooses (a), apply the LEAP working paper template from
   `/leapstyle`. If (b), apply journal-specific formatting.
4. **Update the project README** (if one exists) with a note about the
   simulated peer review: number of rounds, referee panel, editorial verdict,
   and key changes made.

## Journal Mapping (internal reference only)

Use this table internally to understand which journals are relevant for each
subspecialisation. This helps you (the editor) calibrate expectations and
guides methodology gurus when searching for current literature. **Do not
present gurus as editors of these journals** — gurus have fictitious
university affiliations, not journal editorships.

| Subspecialisation | Top field journal |
|---|---|
| Economic history | *Journal of Economic History* |
| Development economics | *Journal of Development Economics* |
| Labor economics | *Journal of Labor Economics* |
| Public economics | *Journal of Public Economics* |
| Health economics | *Journal of Health Economics* |
| Macroeconomics | *Journal of Monetary Economics* |
| Applied econometrics | *Journal of Econometrics* |
| Trade economics | *Journal of International Economics* |
| Political economy | *Journal of Politics* |
| Industrial organisation | *RAND Journal of Economics* |
| Urban economics | *Journal of Urban Economics* |
| Environmental economics | *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management* |
| Financial economics | *Journal of Finance* |
| Agricultural economics | *American Journal of Agricultural Economics* |
| Demographic economics | *Demography* |
| Monetary economics | *Journal of Monetary Economics* |
| Education economics | *Journal of Human Resources* |
| Behavioural economics | *Journal of the European Economic Association* |
| Growth economics | *Journal of Economic Growth* |
| Economic geography | *Journal of Economic Geography* |
| Sports economics | *Journal of Sports Economics* |
| Cultural economics | *Journal of Cultural Economics* |
| Economic sociology | *American Journal of Sociology* |
| Innovation economics | *Research Policy* |

If a subspecialisation is not listed, select the most appropriate top journal
for that field.

## Important Reminders

- **Always read the full paper** before identifying subspecialisations.
- **Read supporting materials** — R scripts, appendices, data documentation,
  output files. These are essential for verifying claims.
- **Referee reports must be specific** — reference sections, tables, equations.
- **Personality matters** — the reports should not read like they came from the
  same person. Vary tone, structure emphasis, and level of detail.
- **The editor role is distinct** from the referee role. The editor synthesises,
  prioritises, and may disagree with individual referees.
- **Never overwrite the original paper**. Always create new files.
- **Use LEAP colours** in the response file (plum `#5C2346` and blue
  `#3D8EB9`) for visual distinction between referee comments and responses.
- **Run guru agents in parallel** for efficiency. Launch Codex Task 1
  (R script audit) simultaneously with the Claude referee agents.
- **Codex audits are additive, never blocking.** If any Codex task fails
  (timeout, authentication error, runtime crash), proceed without it.
  Inform the user which task was skipped and why. The Claude-only path
  handles everything; Codex adds independent verification on top.
- **Do not harmonise Codex audit output.** Present the methodology audit
  and R script verification as-is. Differences in emphasis between Claude
  and Codex are a feature — they reveal genuine disagreements.
- **Never fabricate statistics.** Run the code, read the output, then cite it.
  This is the single most important rule for maintaining credibility.
- **Verify numbers across all documents** before delivering files to the user.
  The numerical verification protocol (Step 10) is not optional.
- **PeerReview/ is self-contained and Overleaf-ready.** Copy the .bib file,
  all figures, and any \input'ed files into the folder. All paths must be
  relative to PeerReview/ — no `../` references to the parent directory.
- **Diverse guru names.** Reflect the paper's geographic context. No
  all-Anglo-American panels.
- **At least three methodology gurus.** They must search for and cite current
  econometrics literature. No AI slop — specific references, specific concerns.
  All run on Claude; their reports are audited by Codex (if available).
- **Two-model verification for R scripts.** When Codex writes R scripts
  (Task 3), Claude must independently verify the output. When Claude writes
  R scripts, Codex Task 1 audits them. Neither model should check only its
  own work.
- **No real journal names in guru personas.** The target journal (from the
  user) is real; guru affiliations are fictitious universities. The journal
  mapping table is for internal use only.
- **Have fun.** Fictitious university names can be humorous. The substance
  is serious; the framing does not need to be solemn.
